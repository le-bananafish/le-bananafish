# Hi, it's me.

> `NB:` _This section is still under construction, please be patient!_

My name is Sebastian Lau. I am either:

- studying for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Linguistics (I'm in my final semester!), or
- pretending to work on my _personal_ projects, and by extension to be a writer, or
- taking naps.

My goal for 2022, is mentioned here (:point_right:) [post][ny-resolution], is that:

> I resolve to write more, work out the issues in my projects, and to be more willing to throw things out.

which is an iteration on the one from 2021:

> I promise to write at least one post per week, or at the bare minimum, once a month.
