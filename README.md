# Hi, it's me.

My name is Sebastian Lau. I am either:

- studying for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Linguistics, or
- working on my _secret_ personal projects, or
- am writing stories, taking naps, or streaming games.

My goal for 2021, as mentioned in this (:point_right:) [post][ny-resolution], is that:

> I promise to write at least one post per week, or at the bare minimum, once a month.
