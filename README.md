# Hi, it's me.

> `NB:` _This section is still under construction, please be patient!_

My name is Sebastian Lau. I am either:

- working as a casual (feels more like part-time!), or
- pretending to work on my _personal_ projects, or
- taking naps.

This year, I have:

- completed my bachelor's degrees in (BSc) Computer Science and (BA) Linguistics and am waiting to graduate.

My goal for 2022, as mentioned here (:point_right:) [post][ny-resolution], is:

> I resolve to write more, work out the issues in my projects, and to be more willing to throw things out.
