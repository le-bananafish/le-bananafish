# Hi, it's me.

> `NB:` _This section is still under construction, please be patient!_

My name is Sebastian Lau. I am:

- studying my postgraduate Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in Linguistics,
- waiting to graduate with my completed bachelor's degrees in (BSc) Computer Science and (BA) Linguistics,
- working as a casual at a retail bookstore,
- and taking naps whenever else

My goal for 2023, as mentioned here (:point_right:) [post][ny-resolution], is:

> [to] stop putting too much pressure on myself
